# Data Structures and Algorithms
I love learning, and I love writing clean code. 

It was only a matter of time before I attempted to compile all the knowledge I have and all the knowledge I could find on Data Structures and Algorithms into a comprehensive notebook. 

These are my notes on Data Structures and Algorithms, compiled from various sources (books, Python docs, source code).

I have made sure to try to actually write out implementation for each major structure. Notes and books without examples are just blagh. I have also tried to make sure to use best practices for every snippet of code. For example, Python docs reccomend using `queue.size == 0` rather than checking `queue.empty`, so I did just that whenever I use a `queue`.

### Future Work:
I would love to write separate structures in separate python files, upload them, and link to them here in a "Table of Contents" style.
